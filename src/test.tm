  <section|The Internal Geometry of Crystals (30-1)>

  When the atoms of matter are not moving around very much, they get stuck
  together and arrange themselves in a configuration with as low an energy as
  possible. Indeed, if atoms in a certain place exhibit order or a pattern
  which seems to be of low energy, then the atoms somewhere else will likely
  make the same arrangement. For these reasons, we have in a solid material,
  a repetitive pattern of atoms.

  The pattern of atoms in a crystal can be found oout experimentally using
  x-ray diffraction, and the presice pattern has been found out
  experimentally for most simple crystals and some complicated ones.

  The internal pattern of a crytal shows up in many ways.\ 

  <\itemize>
    <item>First, the binding strength of atoms in certain directions is
    usually stronger than in other directions. This means that there are
    certain planes through the crystal where it is more easily broken than
    others. These planes are called <with|font-shape|italic|cleavage> planes.

    <item>Second, the internal structure of a crystal often appears at the
    surface of the 3D object because of the way the crystal was formed.
  </itemize>

  <section|Chemical Bonds in Crystals (30-2)>

  The mechanical properties of crystals clearly depend on the kind of
  chemical bindings between the atoms of the crystal.

  <section|The Growth of Crystals (30-3)>

  Try to imagine the natural formation of crystals in the earth. In the
  earth's sruface, there is a big mixture of all kinds of atoms. They are
  being continually churned about by volcanic action, by wind, and by water -
  continually being moved about and mixed.

  Yet, by some trick of nature, silicon atoms gradually begin to find each
  other, and to find oxygen atoms, to make silica. One atom at a time is
  added to the others to build up a crystal - the mixture essentially gets
  <with|font-shape|italic|unmixed>. And, somewhere nearby, sodium and
  chroline atoms are finding each other and building up crystals of salt!

  How does this all happen? How is it the case that once a crystal is started
  that it permits only a particular type of atom to join it? This happens
  because the whole system is working towards a lowest possible energy (as a
  result of 2nd Law of Thermodynamics). A growing crystal will accept a new
  atom if it is going to make the energy as low as possible. But how does it
  <with|font-shape|italic|know> that a silicon - or oxygen - atom at some
  particular spot is going to result in the lowest possible energy? Well, it
  does it by trial and error!

  In the liquid mixture, all of the atoms are in perpetual motion. Each atom
  bounces against its neighbours about <math|10<rsup|13>> times every second.
  If it hits against the right spot of a growing crystal, it has a somewhat
  smaller chance of jumping off again if the energy is low (why is that?). By
  continually testing over periods of millions of years at a rate of
  <math|10<rsup|13>> tests per second, the atoms gradually build up at places
  where they find their lowest energy. Eventually, the grow into big
  crystals. (Does this explain growth at smaller timescales?)

  <section|Crystal Lattices (30-4)>

      The arrangement of atoms in a crystal, called the
      <with|font-shape|italic|crystal lattice> can take on many geometric
      forms. The simplest which characterise most metals are cubic
      structures, the body-centred cubic (BCC) and the face-centred cubic
      (FCC) lattices, see figure on the right. To make the drawing clearer,
      only the \Pcentres\Q of the atoms are shown, in reality the atoms are
      more like spheres in contact with one another. The dark and light
      spheres in the drawing may in general be considered as different kinds
      of atoms, or of the same kind. For instance, iron has a BCC lattice at
      low temperatures and FCC lattice at high temperatures. The physical
      properties are quire different in the two crystalline forms.

  How do such lattice forms come about? Infact, there are many reasons, but
  the main reasons are due to the close-packing of such lattice
  configurations and also partly due to the slight angular dependent of the
  interatomic forces (or, in the case of meatals, on the energy of the
  electron pool).

  <section|Symmetries in Two Dimensions (30-5)>

  Crystals in two dimensions can have many symmetries, indeed, besides the
  identity symmetry operator, the possible symmetry operators are
  <with|font-series|bold|mirror, rotation> and <with|font-series|bold|glide>.
  Infact, rotational symmetry can be broken up into 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 fold
  symmetry, and that is all. Note that 5 fold symmetry does not exist,
  neither does 7+ fold symmetry. In fact, one can also notice that various
  combinations of symmetries can yield either previously defined symmetries,
  or new ones altogether. Indeed, there are a total of 17 different types of
  combinations of symmetries that can be formed in two dimensions.

  <section|Symmetries in Three Dimensions (30-6)>

  Similarly to two dimensions, in three dimensions, there are a total of 230
  types of unique symmetry operations. For some purposes, these 230
  operations can be grouped into 7 classes:
  <with|font-shape|italic|triclinic, trigonal, monoclinic, hexagonal,
  orthorhombic, tetragonal >and <with|font-shape|italic|cubic>, ordered in
  ascending order of the amount of symmetries possible with each class.

  The point of all this discussion about symmetries is that the internal
  symmetries of the crystals show up - sometimes in subtle ways - in the
  macroscopic physical properties of the crystal. For instance, the crystal
  will, in general, have a tensor electric polarisability. If we describe the
  tensor in terms of the ellipsoid of polarisation, we should expect that
  some of the crystals symmetries should also show up in the ellipsoid. For
  example, a cubic crystal is symmetric with respect to a
  <math|90<rsup|\<circ\>>> rotation about any one of its three orthogonal
  directions. Clearly, the only ellipsoid with this property is the sphere.
  Thus, <with|font-shape|italic|a cubic crystal must be an isotropic
  dielectric.>

  <section|The Strength of Metals>

  We have said that metals usually have simple cubic crystal structure; we
  now want to discuss their mechanical properties - which depend on its
  structure.

      Suppose we loook at two layers of a crystal subjected to a shear force,
      as shown on the right. You might first think that the whole layer would
      resist motion until the force was big enough to push the whole upper
      layer \Pover the hump\Q so that it is shiften one notch to the left.
      Although slipping does occur along a plane, it doesn't happen that way,
      and if it did, you would calculate that the material is much stronger
      than it actually is!

      What actually happens is that atoms move one at a time; first atom on
      the left makes a jump, then the next and so on. In effect, it is the
      vacant space between the atoms quickly travels to the right, with the
      net result that the whole second layer has moved over one atomic

  The slipping happens this was because it takes much less energy to lift one
  atom over the hump at a time than it does to lift the whole row (think of
  the usage of pulleys). Once the force is enough to start the process, it
  goes the rest of the way very fast!

  It turns out that in a real crystal, slipping will occur repeatedly at one
  plane, then will stop there and start at some other plane. The details of
  why it starts and stops are quite mysterious (Can two layers not slip at
  the same time?). It is also in fact very strange that successive regions of
  slip are often fairly evenly spaced.

  <paragraph|The dislocation:>The problem of having a \Pmissing\Q atom in one
  row is somewhat more difficult than it might first appear. Such an
  imperfection in a crystal is called a <with|font-shape|italic|dislocation>.
  It is thought that such dislocations are either present when the crystal
  was formed or are generated at some notch/crack at the surface. Once
  dislocations are produced, they can move <with|font-shape|italic|relatively
  freely> through the crystal. Indeed, the gross distorsions of a material
  result from the motions of many of such dislocations.

  By moving freely, we mean that dislocations require little energy to move
  as long as the rest of the lattice is perfect. But, if dislocations
  encounted some orther defect/imperfect (such as a grain boundary),
  dislocations can get \Pstuck\Q. If it takes a lot of energy to overcome
  some imperfection, dislocations will be stopped. This is precisely the
  mechanism that gives strength to imperfect metal crystals.Small
  concentrations of impurity in a crystal may cause enough imperfections to
  effectively immobilise the dislocations. Alternatively, metal's can also be
  <with|font-shape|italic|work hardened> (bent or hit), which through
  deformations can introduce imperfections into the lattice to harden
  materials. This can also be used alongside annealing to create hard metals,
  and is indeed the method used to made hard swords in smitheries.

  The dislocation described above described an
  <with|font-shape|italic|edge/slip dislocation>, although another form of
  dislocation, known as the <with|font-shape|italic|skew dislocation> exists,
  which plays an important part in crystal growth.

      One of the great puzzles for a long time was how crystals can possibly
      grow. We have described above how it is that each atom might, by
      repeated testing, determine whether it was better to be in the crystal
      or not. But that means that each atom must find a place of low energy.
      However, an atom put on a new surface is only bound by one or two bonds
      from below, and doesn't have the same energy it would have if it were
      placed in a corner, where it would have atoms on up to three sides (see
      figure on the right).

      Suppose, we have a growing crystal as a stack of blocks as on the
      right. If we try to place a new block at say position <math|A>, then
      the block will have only one of six neighbours it should ultimately
      get. With so many bonds lacking, its energy is not very low. It would
      be better off at position <math|B>, where it alread has half of its
      quota of bonds, which is indeed what crystals end up doing.\

  But what happens when the line on which <math|B> lies is finished? To start
  a new line, an atom must come to rest with only two sides attached, and
  that is again now very likely. Even if it did, what would happen when the
  whole plane is finished? One answer is that the crystal prefers to grow at
  a dislocation, for instance a screw dislocation. Here, as blocks are added
  to the crytal, there will always be a space where there are tree available
  bonds. The crystal therefore prefers to grow with a dislocation built in.

  <section|The Bragg-Nye Crystal Model (30-9)>

  We cannot see what goes on with the individual atoms in a crystal (maybe
  now we can?), and also, there are many complicated phenomena that are not
  easy to treat quantitatively. Sir Lawrence Braff and J. F. Nye have devised
  a scheme for making a model of a metallic crystal which shows in a
  stricking way many of the phenomena that are believed to occur in a real
  metal, and this is shown in their article <with|font-shape|italic|A dymical
  model of a crystal structure (1947)>.
