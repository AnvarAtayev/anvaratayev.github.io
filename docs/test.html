    <p>
      When the atoms of matter are not moving around very much, they get stuck
      together and arrange themselves in a configuration with as low an energy
      as possible. Indeed, if atoms in a certain place exhibit order or a
      pattern which seems to be of low energy, then the atoms somewhere else
      will likely make the same arrangement. For these reasons, we have in a
      solid material, a repetitive pattern of atoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pattern of atoms in a crystal can be found oout experimentally using
      x-ray diffraction, and the presice pattern has been found out
      experimentally for most simple crystals and some complicated ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The internal pattern of a crytal shows up in many ways. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          First, the binding strength of atoms in certain directions is
          usually stronger than in other directions. This means that there are
          certain planes through the crystal where it is more easily broken
          than others. These planes are called <i>cleavage</i> planes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Second, the internal structure of a crystal often appears at the
          surface of the 3D object because of the way the crystal was formed.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="auto-2">2<span style="margin-left: 1em"></span>Chemical Bonds in Crystals (30-2)<span style="margin-left: 1em"></span></h2>
    <p>
      The mechanical properties of crystals clearly depend on the kind of
      chemical bindings between the atoms of the crystal.
    </p>
    <h2 id="auto-3">3<span style="margin-left: 1em"></span>The Growth of Crystals (30-3)<span style="margin-left: 1em"></span></h2>
    <p>
      Try to imagine the natural formation of crystals in the earth. In the
      earth's sruface, there is a big mixture of all kinds of atoms. They are
      being continually churned about by volcanic action, by wind, and by
      water - continually being moved about and mixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, by some trick of nature, silicon atoms gradually begin to find each
      other, and to find oxygen atoms, to make silica. One atom at a time is
      added to the others to build up a crystal - the mixture essentially gets
      <i>unmixed</i>. And, somewhere nearby, sodium and chroline atoms are
      finding each other and building up crystals of salt!
    </p>
    <p>
      How does this all happen? How is it the case that once a crystal is
      started that it permits only a particular type of atom to join it? This
      happens because the whole system is working towards a lowest possible
      energy (as a result of 2nd Law of Thermodynamics). A growing crystal
      will accept a new atom if it is going to make the energy as low as
      possible. But how does it <i>know</i> that a silicon - or oxygen - atom
      at some particular spot is going to result in the lowest possible
      energy? Well, it does it by trial and error!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the liquid mixture, all of the atoms are in perpetual motion. Each
      atom bounces against its neighbours about <img src="test-1.png" style="margin-left: -0.0248242424242424em; margin-bottom: -0.0496484848484848em; margin-right: -0.0248242424242424em; margin-top: -0.0401454545454546em; vertical-align: 0em; height: 0.92950303030303em"></img> times
      every second. If it hits against the right spot of a growing crystal, it
      has a somewhat smaller chance of jumping off again if the energy is low
      (why is that?). By continually testing over periods of millions of years
      at a rate of <img src="test-1.png" style="margin-left: -0.0248242424242424em; margin-bottom: -0.0496484848484848em; margin-right: -0.0248242424242424em; margin-top: -0.0401454545454546em; vertical-align: 0em; height: 0.92950303030303em"></img> tests per second, the atoms
      gradually build up at places where they find their lowest energy.
      Eventually, the grow into big crystals. (Does this explain growth at
      smaller timescales?)

          The arrangement of atoms in a crystal, called the <i>crystal
          lattice</i> can take on many geometric forms. The simplest which
          characterise most metals are cubic structures, the body-centred
          cubic (BCC) and the face-centred cubic (FCC) lattices, see figure on
          the right. To make the drawing clearer, only the
          &ldquo;centres&rdquo; of the atoms are shown, in reality the atoms
          are more like spheres in contact with one another. The dark and
          light spheres in the drawing may in general be considered as
          different kinds of atoms, or of the same kind. For instance, iron
          has a BCC lattice at low temperatures and FCC lattice at high
          temperatures. The physical properties are quire different in the two
          crystalline forms.

    <p>
      How do such lattice forms come about? Infact, there are many reasons,
      but the main reasons are due to the close-packing of such lattice
      configurations and also partly due to the slight angular dependent of
      the interatomic forces (or, in the case of meatals, on the energy of the
      electron pool).

    <h2 id="auto-5">5<span style="margin-left: 1em"></span>Symmetries in Two Dimensions (30-5)<span
    style="margin-left: 1em"></span></h2>
    <p>
      Crystals in two dimensions can have many symmetries, indeed, besides the
      identity symmetry operator, the possible symmetry operators are
      <b>mirror, rotation</b> and <b>glide</b>. Infact, rotational symmetry
      can be broken up into 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 fold symmetry, and that is all.
      Note that 5 fold symmetry does not exist, neither does 7+ fold symmetry.
      In fact, one can also notice that various combinations of symmetries can
      yield either previously defined symmetries, or new ones altogether.
      Indeed, there are a total of 17 different types of combinations of
      symmetries that can be formed in two dimensions.
    </p>
    <h2 id="auto-6">6<span style="margin-left: 1em"></span>Symmetries in Three Dimensions (30-6)<span
    style="margin-left: 1em"></span></h2>
    <p>
      Similarly to two dimensions, in three dimensions, there are a total of
      230 types of unique symmetry operations. For some purposes, these 230
      operations can be grouped into 7 classes: <i>triclinic, trigonal,
      monoclinic, hexagonal, orthorhombic, tetragonal </i>and <i>cubic</i>,
      ordered in ascending order of the amount of symmetries possible with
      each class.
    </p>
    <p>
      The point of all this discussion about symmetries is that the internal
      symmetries of the crystals show up - sometimes in subtle ways - in the
      macroscopic physical properties of the crystal. For instance, the
      crystal will, in general, have a tensor electric polarisability. If we
      describe the tensor in terms of the ellipsoid of polarisation, we should
      expect that some of the crystals symmetries should also show up in the
      ellipsoid. For example, a cubic crystal is symmetric with respect to a
      <img src="test-3.png" style="margin-left: -0.0248242424242424em; margin-bottom: -0.0496484848484848em; margin-right: -0.0248242424242424em; margin-top: -0.0244848484848486em; vertical-align: 0em; height: 0.781963636363636em"></img> rotation about any one of its three orthogonal
      directions. Clearly, the only ellipsoid with this property is the
      sphere. Thus, <i>a cubic crystal must be an isotropic dielectric.</i>

      We have said that metals usually have simple cubic crystal structure; we
      now want to discuss their mechanical properties - which depend on its
      structure.

          Suppose we loook at two layers of a crystal subjected to a shear
          force, as shown on the right. You might first think that the whole
          layer would resist motion until the force was big enough to push the
          whole upper layer &ldquo;over the hump&rdquo; so that it is shiften
          one notch to the left. Although slipping does occur along a plane,
          it doesn't happen that way, and if it did, you would calculate that
          the material is much stronger than it actually is!
        </p><p>
          What actually happens is that atoms move one at a time; first atom
          on the left makes a jump, then the next and so on. In effect, it is
          the vacant space between the atoms quickly travels to the right,
          with the net result that the whole second layer has moved over one
          atomic spacing.

      The slipping happens this was because it takes much less energy to lift
      one atom over the hump at a time than it does to lift the whole row
      (think of the usage of pulleys). Once the force is enough to start the
      process, it goes the rest of the way very fast!
    </p>
    <p>
      It turns out that in a real crystal, slipping will occur repeatedly at
      one plane, then will stop there and start at some other plane. The
      details of why it starts and stops are quite mysterious (Can two layers
      not slip at the same time?). It is also in fact very strange that
      successive regions of slip are often fairly evenly spaced.

      <h5>The dislocation:<span style="margin-left: 1em"></span></h5>
      <div style="display: inline">
        The problem of having a &ldquo;missing&rdquo; atom in one row is
        somewhat more difficult than it might first appear. Such an
        imperfection in a crystal is called a <i>dislocation</i>. It is
        thought that such dislocations are either present when the crystal was
        formed or are generated at some notch/crack at the surface. Once
        dislocations are produced, they can move <i>relatively freely</i>
        through the crystal. Indeed, the gross distorsions of a material
        result from the motions of many of such dislocations.
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      By moving freely, we mean that dislocations require little energy to
      move as long as the rest of the lattice is perfect. But, if dislocations
      encounted some orther defect/imperfect (such as a grain boundary),
      dislocations can get &ldquo;stuck&rdquo;. If it takes a lot of energy to
      overcome some imperfection, dislocations will be stopped. This is
      precisely the mechanism that gives strength to imperfect metal
      crystals.Small concentrations of impurity in a crystal may cause enough
      imperfections to effectively immobilise the dislocations. Alternatively,
      metal's can also be <i>work hardened</i> (bent or hit), which through
      deformations can introduce imperfections into the lattice to harden
      materials. This can also be used alongside annealing to create hard
      metals, and is indeed the method used to made hard swords in smitheries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dislocation described above described an <i>edge/slip
      dislocation</i>, although another form of dislocation, known as the
      <i>skew dislocation</i> exists, which plays an important part in crystal
      growth.

          One of the great puzzles for a long time was how crystals can
          possibly grow. We have described above how it is that each atom
          might, by repeated testing, determine whether it was better to be in
          the crystal or not. But that means that each atom must find a place
          of low energy. However, an atom put on a new surface is only bound
          by one or two bonds from below, and doesn't have the same energy it
          would have if it were placed in a corner, where it would have atoms
          on up to three sides (see figure on the right).

      But what happens when the line on which <img src="test-6.png" style="margin-left: -0.0248242424242424em; margin-bottom: -0.0248242424242424em; margin-right: -0.0248242424242424em; margin-top: -0.0255515151515152em; vertical-align: 0em; height: 0.757139393939394em"></img> lies is
      finished? To start a new line, an atom must come to rest with only two
      sides attached, and that is again now very likely. Even if it did, what
      would happen when the whole plane is finished? One answer is that the
      crystal prefers to grow at a dislocation, for instance a screw
      dislocation. Here, as blocks are added to the crytal, there will always
      be a space where there are tree available bonds. The crystal therefore
      prefers to grow with a dislocation built in.

      We cannot see what goes on with the individual atoms in a crystal (maybe
      now we can?), and also, there are many complicated phenomena that are
      not easy to treat quantitatively. Sir Lawrence Braff and J. F. Nye have
      devised a scheme for making a model of a metallic crystal which shows in
      a stricking way many of the phenomena that are believed to occur in a
      real metal, and this is shown in their article <i>A dymical model of a
      crystal structure (1947)</i>.
