I've always been intrested in astrophotography, and is something I would like to dabble in.
Having recently obtained a mirrorless camera (specifically the Fujifilm XS-10 with a standard 18-55mm lens) and moved into property with a garden, I feel that I am ready to start. I will use this blog post to keep track of my thoughts an processes, and provide here information that I find particularly useful in this process.

# Getting Started
First of all, I am in possession of an 18-55mm lens, and to my very basic understanding, this may not be enough for great astrophotography, but hey ho, lets give it a go, and see how far we can get.

## Gear
Following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kr66REwh23s) YouTube video, we will need the following to get started.
- DSLR/Mirorrless camera ✅
- Tripod ❌
- Wide angle lens ❌
- Remote shutter ❌

## Settings
- Widest possible setting
  - This is often measured in terms of focal length, i.e. the `f` setting. We want this to be the largest we can get it.
- Sbutter speed: 25-30s
- ISO: high to collect as much data as possible, 3200-6400
- Focus: manual focus
  - Since we're performing astrophotography, there is nothing in particular to focus on. This may be different in the case of lunar photography, which we will touch on at some later point.
- Turn of long exposure noise reduction if enabled
