      We need syntax highlighting computations when rendering verbatim code
      snippets and also when exporting to HTML, for example. Currently there
      is some parsing library written in C++ inside TeXmacs (see the
      <tt>src/System/Language</tt> directory), but this does not cover HTML
      output and it is quite rudimentary. In this blog for example we achieve
      syntax-highlighting for HTML via an external JavaScript library. It
      would be useful just to output the appropriate elaborated text (together
      with a plain-text version for copy/paste). In general it could be maybe
      interesting to evaluate the use of external libraries for syntax
      analysis of programming languages.

          Tree-sitter is a recent interesting library for computing
          incrementally an AST for a piece of text, including error recovery.
          It is written in C/C++ with no external dependencies (as it is
          claimed) which make relatively easy an inclusion in TeXmacs. The
          github <a href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/">link</a>, and a presentation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jes3bD6P0To">talk</a> on
          youtube.

      It could be useful for us to be able to parse the <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org">Markdown</a>
      format. There are various available parsers which could be integrated as
      plugins in the codebase, for example <a href="https://github.com/jgm/peg-markdown">PEG-markdown</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vmg/sundown">sundown</a>,
      <a href="https://fossil.instinctive.eu/libsoldout/index">libsoldout</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mity/md4c">md4c</a> and also some native scheme
      implementations like <a href="https://bitbucket.org/DerGuteMoritz/lowdown/src/master/">lowdown</a> for Chicken Scheme. Currently
      in TeXmacs we do not have a generic way to parse external languages: for
      example internally the parsing of HTML or TeX is done via C++ code
      without any common parsing substrate (as far as I can see). There is
      some support for packrat parsing but it is used only in the semantic
      checking of math formulas and it seems that the packrat parser is not
      capable of semantic actions, i.e. can only report if a string (or tree?)
      belongs to some language or not. Tree-sitter could also be an option as
      generic parsing mechanism. It could be useful to think how to factor and
      restructure the parsing mechanisms in TeXmacs to avoid duplicating
      code/efforts/know-how.

      This could be an area where we can improve substantially over
      LaTeX-based workflows, probably. We need to check what is done in other

          <a href="https://github.com/languagetool-org/languagetool">Languagetool</a> is a (big) open source Java system for
          grammar correction in various languages. Maybe it is conceivable to
          offer the possibility to use it as an external service (on the web
          or locally).

          <a href="https://jupyter.org">Jupyter</a> is a protocol to interface clients to
          computational kernels (Python, Julia, Haskell,). We already have a
          very primitive plugin here <a href="https://github.com/mgubi/tm_jupyter">tm_jupyter</a> (written in
          Python). It could potentially replace many of our various plugins
          and allow easier maintenance. Moreover it could allow TeXmacs to be
          an alternative to Jupyter notebooks or <a href="https://github.com/mgubi/tm_jupyter"> Jupyter Qt
          Console</a>. One can look to these projects to understand which
          features have to be supported. Jeroen has improved the tm_jupyter
          plugin <a href="https://github.com/woutersj/tm_jupyter/commits/master">here</a>.

          In general this could be related to literate programming
          capabilities/projects.

      PDF gives the possibility to embed arbitrary content within the document
      as &ldquo;Embedded file&rdquo; streams. This possibility is exploited by
      the LaTeX package <a href="https://mirror.ibcp.fr/pub/CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/attachfile/attachfile.pdf">attachfile</a> which allows to associate to
      typesetted parts of the document arbitrary attachments with the
      possibility to recover it. We could introduce a similar feature in
      TeXmacs documents, i.e. include external content in the document.
      Another possibility is to include a TeXmacs document within a generated
      PDF file in such a way that it is possible to open the PDF from TeXmacs
      and edit its source. Another use could be to include TeXmacs snippets in
      copied PDF files so that they could be reopened in TeXmacs and modified.

      Modifications to the documents are incremental, so one would like to
      take this into account when recomputing both the typesetting and the
      rendering onscreen. This problem is also relevant when syncronizing
      live-editing document across a network connection. Some infrastructure
      is already present in TeXmacs (details?). Here are gathered some
      approaches to incremental computations in a general context.
