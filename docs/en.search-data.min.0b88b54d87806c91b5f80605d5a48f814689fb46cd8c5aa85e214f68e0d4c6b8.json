Having recently obtained a mirrorless camera (specifically the Fujifilm XS-10 with a standard 18-55mm lens) and moved into property with a garden, I feel that I am ready to start. I will use this blog post to keep track of my thoughts an processes, and provide here information that I find particularly useful in this process.\nGetting Started # First of all, I am in possession of an 18-55mm lens, and to my very basic understanding, this may not be enough for great astrophotography, but hey ho, lets give it a go, and see how far we can get.\nGear # Following this YouTube video, we will need the following to get started.\nDSLR/Mirorrless camera ✅ Tripod ❌ Wide angle lens ❌ Remote shutter ❌ Settings # Widest possible setting This is often measured in terms of focal length, i.e. the f setting. We want this to be the largest we can get it. Sbutter speed: 25-30s ISO: high to collect as much data as possible, 3200-6400 Focus: manual focus Since we\u0026rsquo;re performing astrophotography, there is nothing in particular to focus on. This may be different in the case of lunar photography, which we will touch on at some later point.

This is a well known proof and can be found in Wikipedia1, although I found this proof in an article posted by Fermat\u0026rsquo;s Library 2.\nTheorem \u0026nbsp;(Fermat\u0026#39;s Little Theorem) If $p$ is a prime number and $p \\nmid n$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, then $n^p \\equiv n \\mod p$. Proof Let\u0026rsquo;s say that you want to make as many distinct types of necklaces as you can with $p$ (colourless) beads at your disposal, and where you can colour each bead with $n$ different colours. Assume also you only want to make multi-coloured necklaces, and that $p$ is prime.\nWhat we can initially do is put all of our beads on some open-ended string, which we\u0026rsquo;ll call a chain, and once we join the ends of our chain, we will get a necklace. On each bead, we can choose from $n$ colours, and therefore we can make $n \\cdot n \\cdot n \\cdots n = n^p$ such chains. If one wishes, one can make a whole chain, and therefore necklace, of one colour, and as there are $n$ colours to choose from, we can make $n$ distinct monotone chains. Since we only wish to make multi-coloured necklaces, we are left with $n^p-n$ potential chains, e.g. R-G-G, R-G-B.\nCombining the ends of our chains, we now make a necklace. We notice straight away that some necklaces are identical up to a rotation (i.e. cyclic permutation), e.g. the necklace from the chain R-G-B is the same as from the chains G-B-R and B-R-G after a rotation. Since there are $p$ beads in each necklace, and $p$ is prime, each necklace has $p$ identical (up to rotation) necklaces. Therefore, we can make $\\frac{n^p-n}{p}$ (an integer) distinct necklaces, i.e. $n^p \\equiv n \\mod p$, which concludes our proof.\nWikipedia: Proof of Fermat\u0026rsquo;s Little Theorem\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nFermat\u0026rsquo;s Library Article\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"}]
