      In a <a href="./scheme-graphics.html">previous note</a>, we have shown an example of TeXmacs
      native graphics generated with , a triangle inscribed in a half-circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let us see how to embed it seamlessly in a document. Our work is
      based on   environments, available under  (and then choose the  option).
    </p>
    <p>
      Since in each  environment it is possible to execute one  instruction
      only, we will wrap all of the code inside a  form.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more complex drawings users may feel the need of more efficient
      facilities to compose, test and deploy into TeXmacs their code. We are
      going to discuss some available tools in a future post.
    </p>
    <p>
      A synthetic discussion of TeXmacs graphics primitives and how to code
      them in  is in the <a href="./scheme-graphics.html">previous note</a> (see also the manual, in
      ). Here let us just remind that TeXmacs graphics are composed by listing
      graphical objects, each made by the application of a graphical
      primitive, inside a  primitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the code we ue in this note, we introduce a function  that generates 
      primitives, (which are parametrized by two numbers, expressed as
      strings), and with it we generate points that we will use to build other
      primitives (, ,  and ).
    </p>
    <p>
      In turn, TeXmacs will use the primitives to represent the triangle, the
      half-circle and the decorations, that is the drawing that we will embed
      in the document.
    </p>
    <p>
      We open the environment with  and we obtain the yellow box we got used
      to in the note on <a href="./embedding-tikz-figures-short.html">embedding TikZ graphics</a>, in this case
      introduced by a <samp>Scheme</samp> title on a gray background:
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Press  and type or paste the graphics command; in this note let us copy
      the same commands that generate the drawing in the <a href="./scheme-graphics.html">previous
      note</a>, wrapping everything in a  form as we already said:
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      The last step is pressing  to execute the code and generate the drawing.
      We do it in a  environment () to demonstrate seamless embedding:
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      The drawing we generated is editable in two different ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Placing the cursor at the drawing (just after or just before, the
      drawing is then surrounded by a thin cyan frame) and pressing  brings
      back the yellow edit window, where the code can be changed and
      re-executed into a new drawing.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also possible to edit the drawing with the interactive (point and
      click) facilities. In this case too it is always possible to return to
      the text-editing mode of the  environment by pressing  with the cursor
      at the drawing, but if one does that, the interactive modifications are
      lost, i.e. one gets back to the  code one had typed into the 
      environment.
