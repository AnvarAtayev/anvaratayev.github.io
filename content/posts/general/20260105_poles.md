Whilst listening to the 2025 Christmas episode of *The Infinite Monkey Cage* {{< cite "BBCInfiniteMonkey2025" >}} - a comedic science podcast hosted by the BBC, and one that I would highly recommend - there was a discussion on all the different types and interpretations of the North Pole. This is a short post to visualise the poles discussed in this podcast.

The different north poles discussed were (snapshot as of January 2026):
- <span style="color:#f2f2f2;">●</span> Geographic - the true north pole at Earth's rotation axis {{< pole-coords id="geographic" >}}
- <span style="color:#ff6b6b;">●</span> Magnetic - where a compass needle points; wanders over time {{< cite "WikiMagneticPole" >}}, for updated positions and a visualisation of pole drift over time, see {{< cite "NOAAWanderingPoles" >}} {{< pole-coords id="magnetic" >}}
- <span style="color:#4ea3ff;">●</span> Geo-Magnetic - best‑fit dipole pole from the global field model {{< cite "WikiGeomagneticPole" >}} {{< pole-coords id="geomagnetic" >}}
- <span style="color:#f2c14e;">●</span> Pole of Inaccessibility/Arctic Pole - farthest point from any landmass {{< cite "WikiInaccessibility" >}} {{< pole-coords id="inaccessibility" >}}
- <span style="color:#7bd1c8;">●</span> Pole of Ice - Oymyakon, Russia (coldest permanently inhabited place) {{< cite "WikiOymyakon" >}} {{< pole-coords id="ice" >}}

Note: there is also a celestial north pole — the direction Earth’s rotation axis points on the sky {{< cite "WikiCelestialPole" >}}. It coincides with the geographic pole on this axis, so I’m not plotting it separately here.
